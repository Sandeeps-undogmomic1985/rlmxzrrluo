Just got out of The Woman in the Yard, and wow, I'm not even sure what just happened in there. Like, my brain is a tangled mess of “what the heck?” and “did that really just occur?” First off, the title. I mean, you'd think the yard is important, right? Nope. At least not in any way you'd expect. The yard is there, sure, but it's like that background character you ignore until they suddenly start disco-dancing behind the dialogue. Always sort of in the peripherals, doing its own thing while the   thinks it’s being deep.

For real though, the lead actress? She had this look that screamed “I just woke up, and I don't know if I'm here for breakfast or a hostage situation.” Which, oddly, sort of mirrored my state after that convoluted plot twist halfway through. I mean, I get twists, but this one was like a rollercoaster built by someone who gets dizzy on escalators. One minute I'm absorbing a slow emotional scene, next thing BAM, homicidal raccoon — metaphorically speaking, but who even knows.

> The soundtrack was there and not there all at once. You ever have that moment where you hear elevator music and wonder if it's actually playing or just in your head? Yeah, like that. Subtle and weirdly intrusive like when your nose itches during a quiet moment and you gotta decide between scratching it or maintaining your dignity. Scratch it. Always scratch it.

And can we talk about the lighting? Oh boy, was it ever an entity of its own! Half the time, I couldn’t tell if they were trying to make a point about duality or if someone’s garage door was caught halfway down, throwing patchy, ominous shadows everywhere. Maybe both. Most believable character, to be honest.

// MovieTheWomanInTheYard.cpp
// Epic confusion levels engaged
#include <io𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮>
int main() {
    std::cout << Plot twist: Huh? What just happened? << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

Tired rant aside, I'm honestly kind of glad I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it (not saying you need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   right away or whatever, but, hey, choices). There's something to be said for a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that leaves you confused but in a sort of pleasantly annoyed way. You know? Like that itch you finally got to scratch. Would I say it's worth theater popcorn prices? Jury's still out. Maybe catch it when you need a good “huh” moment, or just want to know what cinematographic daylight hallucinations look like.
